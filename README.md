# lauzhack2017

This is @lmayencourt and myself's take on the Logitech challenge for Lauzhack 2017.
This is meant to be run on a Windows machine, along with a Logitech G810.

Required tools:
- Logitech Gaming Software to have the LED DLL.
- A working python environment with Numpy, Scipy, Matploblib (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
- The ffmpeg Windows .exes, to add to your %PATH% (http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)
- The volume info .exe referenced by https://superuser.com/a/1177243, to add to your %PATH%
